# Car Selling Price Prediction

This repository, **car_sp_pred**, is a machine learning project focused on predicting car selling prices. The project demonstrates the end-to-end process of building a regression model to estimate the selling price of cars using various features.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis
- Feature engineering and selection
- Model training and evaluation (regression)
- Jupyter Notebooks for step-by-step reproducibility

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BirendraKSharma/car_sp_pred.git
   cd car_sp_pred
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   There is no `requirements.txt` in this repository. Please ensure you have the following Python packages installed (commonly used for regression projects):
   - `numpy`
   - `pandas`
   - `scikit-learn`
   - `matplotlib`
   - `seaborn`
   - `jupyter`

   You can install them with:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
   ```

3. **Run Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Open the relevant notebook and follow the instructions to explore, train, and evaluate the model.

## Project Workflow

1. Load and inspect the dataset.
2. Clean and preprocess the data.
3. Explore data with visualizations.
4. Engineer features relevant to car pricing.
5. Train regression models.
6. Evaluate model performance.
7. Predict car prices on new data.
